A suite of Python scripts to fit NH3 lines along a PV slice:

- pvslice.py: Make PV slices using pvextractor, and save in FITS images

- pvdiagram.py: Make PV plots (half-tone images and contours)

- pvfit.py: Fit NH3 spectra along the PV slice pixel by pixel, and save the best-fit temperatures, Vlsr, line widths, etc.

- pvplot\_piecewise.py: Plot the best-fit Vlsr (i.e., a nicer PV diagram?), and subtract a piece-wise linear function

- allfilplot.py: Plot the best-fit temperatures and line widths along the PV slice
